# Forecasting Demand for Behavioral Health Services
In the midst of the ever-growing mental health crisis, the demand for behavioral health services has surged to new heights. This project embarks on a journey to harness the power of social determinants of health and behavioral health service utilization data, seeking to forecast future demand with precision and foresight.

### Throughout this project, we will:
- Obtain data from the Snowflake marketplace.
- Utilize Snowpark to connect to our Snowflake instance and explore data, constructing our forecasting model.
- Employ Shipyard for automating machine learning workflows.
- Present model results through a front-end Hex dashboard.
